## Getting Started

Modern ```omic``` technologies have enabled quantitative checking of numerous biological sample types in an unprecedented scale. Hence, omic data integration could provide more biological insight than traditional single data source analyses. However, data integration involves both simultaneous analysis of raw data and meta-analysis of the obtained results, in order to select gene/protein/metabolite candidates. Indeed, these are not easy tasks at all and are under continuous development.

Here, we present the ```kimod```  ```R``` package which is freely available at Bioconductor under the GNU General Public License. It implements a novel algorithm that uses a combination of k-tables and biplot approach to tackle both problems simultaneously, i. e., studies integration and gene/protein/metabolite selection using multiple data sources. It also incorporates bootstrap analysis for result's stability and sample's variability.
