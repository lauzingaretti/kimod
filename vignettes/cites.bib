abstract = {UNLABELLED: For characterization of genetic diversity in genotypes several molecular techniques, usually resulting in a binary data matrix, have been used. Despite the fact that in Cluster Analysis (CA) and Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) the interpretation of the variables responsible for grouping is not straightforward, these methods are commonly used to classify genotypes using DNA molecular markers. In this article, we present a novel algorithm that uses a combination of PCoA, CA and Logistic Regression (LR), as a better way to interpret the variables (alleles or bands) associated to the classification of genotypes. The combination of three standard techniques with some new ideas about the geometry of the procedures, allows constructing an External Logistic Biplot (ELB) that helps in the interpretation of the variables responsible for the classification or ordination. An application of the method to study the genetic diversity of four populations from Africa, Asia and Europe, using the HapMap data is included.

AVAILABILITY: The Matlab code for implementing the methods may be obtained from the web site: http://biplot.usal.es.},

@article{Shankavaram2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Advances in the high-throughput omic technologies have made it possible to profile cells in a large number of ways at the DNA, RNA, protein, chromosomal, functional, and pharmacological levels. A persistent problem is that some classes of molecular data are labeled with gene identifiers, others with transcript or protein identifiers, and still others with chromosomal locations. What has lagged behind is the ability to integrate the resulting data to uncover complex relationships and patterns. Those issues are reflected in full form by molecular profile data on the panel of 60 diverse human cancer cell lines (the NCI-60) used since 1990 by the U.S. National Cancer Institute to screen compounds for anticancer activity. To our knowledge, CellMiner is the first online database resource for integration of the diverse molecular types of NCI-60 and related meta data.

DESCRIPTION: CellMiner enables scientists to perform advanced querying of molecular information on NCI-60 (and additional types) through a single web interface. CellMiner is a freely available tool that organizes and stores raw and normalized data that represent multiple types of molecular characterizations at the DNA, RNA, protein, and pharmacological levels. Annotations for each project, along with associated metadata on the samples and datasets, are stored in a MySQL database and linked to the molecular profile data. Data can be queried and downloaded along with comprehensive information on experimental and analytic methods for each data set. A Data Intersection tool allows selection of a list of genes (proteins) in common between two or more data sets and outputs the data for those genes (proteins) in the respective sets. In addition to its role as an integrative resource for the NCI-60, the CellMiner package also serves as a shell for incorporation of molecular profile data on other cell or tissue sample types.

CONCLUSION: CellMiner is a relational database tool for storing, querying, integrating, and downloading molecular profile data on the NCI-60 and other cancer cell types. More broadly, it provides a template to use in providing such functionality for other molecular profile data generated by academic institutions, public projects, or the private sector. CellMiner is available online at (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/).},

@article{Reinhold2012,
abstract = {High-throughput and high-content databases are increasingly important resources in molecular medicine, systems biology, and pharmacology. However, the information usually resides in unwieldy databases, limiting ready data analysis and integration. One resource that offers substantial potential for improvement in this regard is the NCI-60 cell line database compiled by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, which has been extensively characterized across numerous genomic and pharmacologic response platforms. In this report, we introduce a CellMiner (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/) web application designed to improve the use of this extensive database. CellMiner tools allowed rapid data retrieval of transcripts for 22,379 genes and 360 microRNAs along with activity reports for 20,503 chemical compounds including 102 drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Converting these differential levels into quantitative patterns across the NCI-60 clarified data organization and cross-comparisons using a novel pattern match tool. Data queries for potential relationships among parameters can be conducted in an iterative manner specific to user interests and expertise. Examples of the in silico discovery process afforded by CellMiner were provided for multidrug resistance analyses and doxorubicin activity; identification of colon-specific genes, microRNAs, and drugs; microRNAs related to the miR-17-92 cluster; and drug identification patterns matched to erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and lapatinib. CellMiner greatly broadens applications of the extensive NCI-60 database for discovery by creating web-based processes that are rapid, flexible, and readily applied by users without bioinformatics expertise.},
